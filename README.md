=== To Make Highlights === <br>
-> To run the ML model, first go to where the main.py is located then use command "python main.py" or "python3.py" <br>
-> Make sure that the video file from which the highlights are to be extracted is in "uploads" folder. <br>
-> After running, it will take some time to proceed based on the size and length of the video. <br>
-> Firstly, it will generate all the small highlights, then it will combine all the hilights in one final video. <br>
 <br>

 === Make Sure That These Paths are Set Properly in (main.py)===  <br>
-> FFMPEG_PATH = "C:/Users/Bhaumit/Important Software Files/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared/bin/ffmpeg.exe". <br>
-> video_file = "F:/game-highlights-extraction/uploads/new_v.mp4". <br>


!!! To test the model, using small size and length video is preferable. <br>
 <br>

== To View Highlights on Webpge === <br>
-> Use command "node server.js" <br>
-> Click on the link generated by the same command on terminal. <br>
